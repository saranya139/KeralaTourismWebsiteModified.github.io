    <h1 style="color: blueviolet;"><center><u>IDUKKI</u></center></h1>
    <br>
    <P>Idukki (ഇടുക്കി), IPA: [iɖukːi], is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.[4][5] It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by taking Peerumade, Udumbanchola, Devikulam taluks from Kottayam district and Thodupuzha taluk of Ernakulam district.[6] Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Cardamom Hills of Western Ghats in Kerala.

        Though it is the second-largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala. There are only two municipalities in the district and the urban population is comparatively much lower than the rural population.</P>

    <h1 style="color: brown;"><center>History</center></h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Idukki district forms a high altitude plateau with rugged mountainous terrain, several river valleys and deep gorges.[7] The entire northern part of the district forms a sub plateau higher than the rest of the district, this region includes the tallest peaks like Anamudi and includes the areas around Munnar, Pallivasal, Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Mankulam. The Pambar river valley (Marayoor, Keezhanthoor) forms an eastern sloping rain shadow region of the Western Ghats. The eastern frontier of the district (Kumily, Kattapana, Nedumkandam, Rajakumari and Ramakkalmedu) constitutes the Cardamon hills. The western part of the district is covered by forests and hills bordering the eastern regions of Ernakulam and Kottayam district like Neriyamangalam, Vannapuram, Thommankuthu, Moolamattom, Vagamon and Kuttikanam. Places like Thodupuzha, Koothattukulam, Udumbanoor and Muttom are situated in the semi elevated Thodupuzha river plains with scattered hills. The Periyar river basin in the district which includes Vandiperiyar, Ayyapankoil, Rajakkad, Idukki, Cheruthoni and Adimaly is an elevated plateau crisscrossed by river valleys and lies between the high peaks of the western and eastern parts of the district. The southern region is entirely covered with the forests of the Periyar National Park.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The Idukki dam is constructed across the Periyar River, in a valley between the Kuravan and Kurathi hills in Kerala. The awe-inspiring, majestic dam, which stands at 167.68 meters (550 ft), is one of the highest arch dams in Asia. The dam, which is one of the Idukki tourist places, constructed by the Kerala government in 1975 and supports 780 MW hydroelectric power station that draws electricity from this dam.

                The sheer magnitude of the structure along with the mountains, verdant vegetation, and 60 sq. km placid lake, which is created by the 3 dams, Idukki dam, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu, captivate the visitors.

              <p class="card-text">Ilaveezha Poonchira, the Shangri-La of Kerala, situated in Melukavu village in Kottayam district is one of the places to visit in Idukki. Located at the foothills of the 3 floral hillocks – Mankunnu, Kudayathur, and Thonippara Hills at Kanjar, the bewitching valley is spread across thousands of acres.

                “Ila-veezha Poonchira” which means “the pond of flowers where the leaves do not fall” has its roots in Mahabharata. The rains during the monsoon season transmogrify the valley and present an enthralling and hypnotic effect on the visitors. Words fall short to explain the beatitudes of the play of colors on the horizon during the Sunrise and Sunset. Ilaveezha Poonchira is also an ideal destination for trekking.
