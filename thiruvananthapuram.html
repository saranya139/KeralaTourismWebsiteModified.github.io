    <br>
    <P>Thiruvananthapuram (/ˌtɪruːvəˌnʌntəˈpʊərəm/; Malayalam: [t̪iɾuʋɐnɐn̪d̪ɐpuɾɐm] (listen)), also known by its former name Trivandrum /trɪˈvændrəm/,[8] is the capital of the Indian state of Kerala. It is the most populous city in Kerala with a population of 957,730 as of 2011.[3] The encompassing urban agglomeration population is around 1.68 million.[5] Located on the west coast of India near the extreme south of the mainland, Thiruvananthapuram is a major information technology hub in Kerala and contributes 55% of the state's software exports as of 2016.[9][10] Referred to by Mahatma Gandhi as the "Evergreen city of India",[11][1] the city is characterised by its undulating terrain of low coastal hills.[12]

        The present regions that constitute Thiruvananthapuram were ruled by the Ays who were feudatories of the Chera dynasty.[13] In the 12th century, it was conquered by the Kingdom of Venad.[13] In the 18th century the king Marthanda Varma expanded the territory and founded the princely state of Travancore and made Thiruvananthapuram its capital.[14] Travancore became the most dominant state in Kerala by defeating the powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755.[15] Following India's independence in 1947, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of Travancore-Cochin state and remained so until the new Indian state of Kerala was formed in 1956.[16]
        
        Thiruvananthapuram is a notable academic and research hub and home to the University of Kerala, APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, the regional headquarters of Indira Gandhi National Open University, and many other schools and colleges. Thiruvananthapuram is also home to research centers such as the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Indian Space Research Organisation's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, National Centre for Earth Science Studies and a campus of the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research.[17] The city is home to media institutions like Toonz India Ltd and Tata Elxsi Ltd, and is also home to Chitranjali Film Studio, one of the first film studios in Malayalam Cinema, and Kinfra Film and Video Park at Kazhakoottom, which is India's first Infotainment industrial park.
    <br>
    
    <h1 style="color: brown;"><center>History</center></h1>
    <br>
    <p>Thiruvananthapuram is a relatively modern region with trading traditions dating back to 1000 BCE.[26][27] It is believed that the ships of King Solomon landed in a port called Ophir (now Poovar) in Thiruvananthapuram in 1036 BCE.[28][29] The city was the trading post of spices, sandalwood and ivory.[30] However, the ancient political and cultural history of the city was almost entirely independent from that of the rest of Kerala.

        The Chera dynasty governed the area of Malabar Coast between Alappuzha in the south to Kasaragod in the north. This included Palakkad Gap, Coimbatore, Salem, and Kolli Hills. The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the Malabar Coast and Tamil Nadu.[31] However the southern region of present-day Kerala state (The coastal belt between Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha) was under Ay dynasty, who was more related to the Pandya dynasty of Madurai.[32]
        
        The early rulers of the city were the Ays. Vizhinjam, which is now a region in the present-day Thiruvananthapuram, was the capital of the Ay dynasty.[33] Vizhinjam was an important port city from as early as 2nd century BC.[34][35] During the Ay dynasty rule, Thiruvananthapuram witnessed many battles in which the Chola and Pandyan dynasties attempted to capture the port town.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Located adjacent to Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Kuthiramalika Palace Museum is the rarest specimen of workmanship. Built by Maharaja Swathi Balarama Varma, this palace displays valuable collections of royal family.
                Beside the rich collection that it displays, this museum is an exemplary example of traditional Travancore-style architecture.  Intricate wood carvings and distinctive patterns constitute a masterpiece of its kinds. Overhanging attics, pillar-lined courtyards and sloping roofs contribute to the exclusive look of the museum.
                
                Visitors can expect a display of a collection, including Belgian mirrors, paintings, Kathakali mannequins, exquisite traditional furniture. The two royal thrones; one manufactured of Bohemian crystals, embossed with an emblem of ‘Conch’ on the backrest and the other made of ivory are the prime attractions of the museum. Marble-made idols and sculptures, musical instruments and the alcove used by Swami Thirunal have also been kept in the showcase. An illusion portrait by veteran painter Sveroslav Roerich is another attractive feature here.
